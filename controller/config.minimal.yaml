# Volteria Controller - Minimal Configuration
# Generated by setup wizard - DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY
# All settings (site, devices, control) are fetched from cloud
#
# This is the NEW recommended configuration format.
# The controller will fetch all other settings from the Volteria platform.

# ============================================
# CONTROLLER IDENTIFICATION
# ============================================
controller:
  # Controller UUID - from the setup wizard
  id: "YOUR-CONTROLLER-UUID-HERE"
  # Serial number - matches what you entered in the wizard
  serial_number: "RPI5-001"

# ============================================
# CLOUD CONNECTION
# ============================================
cloud:
  # Supabase project URL
  supabase_url: "https://usgxhzdctzthcqxyxfxl.supabase.co"
  # Supabase anon key (public, safe to include)
  supabase_key: "YOUR-ANON-KEY-HERE"
  # Enable cloud sync
  sync_enabled: true

# ============================================
# HOW IT WORKS
# ============================================
# 1. Controller starts and reads this minimal config
# 2. Connects to cloud using controller.id
# 3. If assigned to a site: fetches full config (devices, settings)
# 4. If NOT assigned: waits and checks every 60 seconds
# 5. Once assigned, starts the control loop
#
# All configuration is managed via the Volteria platform:
# - Site assignment
# - Device configuration (Modbus addresses)
# - Control settings (DG reserve, intervals)
# - Safe mode settings
